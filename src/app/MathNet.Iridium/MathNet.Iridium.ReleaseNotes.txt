SUMMARY
-------

- 3 Bugs fixed (see below)
- Linear Algebra: Matrix Kronecker product, new Vector class, perf (caching)
- Core: Sinc function, neper/decibel ratio routines.
- Probability Distributions: New: Student's-T, F, Skew-Alpha Stable.
- Assemblies no longer signed with a certificate (because verification caused network access)


NEW FEATURES
------------

IRID-113: Core - Neper and Decibel Helper and Factors
IRID-116: Core - Sinc Function
IRID-111: Linear Algebra - Matrix Kronecker Tensor Product

SUMMARY
-------

- 8 Bugs fixed (see below)
- Performance: The linear algebra implementation has ben optimized, resulting in nearly 50% perf gain.
- New Robust Linear Regression (IRLS algorithm)
- Api References: Inline Xml Documentation has been improved (but is still far from where we'd like it to be).
- Security: The released binaries now have a strong name, are locked down with code access security and allow
  partial trusted callers. We now use test-signing internally. Also, the official assemblies are now signed with a certificate.
- Build/Release Integration: We now moved completely to custom msbuild targets, releases are now fully automated
  (incl. documentation generation) and the continuous integration system has been upgraded.
  Since releasing is now much easier, you can expect new releases more often.


NEW FEATURES
------------

IRID-32: Core - Provide Constants + Update Scientific Constants to CODATA 2007
IRID-87: Probability Distributions - InverseCumulativeDistribution for LogNormal


ENHANCEMENTS
------------

IRID-82: Documentation - Update inline XML documentation
IRID-91: Linear Algebra - Conversion to double[,]
IRID-96: Linear Algebra - Use jagged arrays as internal data structure. 50% Perf Gain.
IRID-78: Transformations - Increase Supported FFT Sample Size to 2097152


FIXED BUGS
----------

IRID-77: Core - Complex number natural log bug
IRID-89: Core - Regularized Beta Function returns inverted result in some cases
IRID-92: Core - Polynomial copy constructor doesn't set order field
IRID-90: Linear Algebra - Inverting Matrix via Cholesky and LUD - different results.
IRID-88: Probability Distributions - ErlangDistribution number generator produces unexpected shape
IRID-85: Probability Distributions - Distribution Constructor Bug: Beta, Chi, ChiSquare, LogNormal, Normal
IRID-86: Probability Distributions - NormalDistribution Class
IRID-72: Statistics - Accumulator bug fixed (patch provided)


OTHER
-----

IRID-93: Core - Signing, Strong Name, Code Access Security
IRID-94: Core - Release Automation
IRID-95: Core - Rename Newgrad, NewDegree -> Grad
IRID-7:  Unit Tests - Restore temporarely removed Unit Tests
